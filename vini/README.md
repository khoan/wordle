## Wordle Game: Guess the Hidden Word

Wordle gives you six chances to guess a randomly word with five letters. If you have the right letter in the right square position, it shows up green. A correct letter in the wrong spot shows up yellow. A letter that does not contains in the word it shows up black-ish.
This game is my first project oriented by General Assembly.

##### History & Credits
