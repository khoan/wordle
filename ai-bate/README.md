Built with
-------------------
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript

My Approach
------------------------------
* I kept it simple and so I can focus on building the game logic using Javascript.

Improvement
-----------------------------
* Use dictionary API
* flip the tile one by one 
* localStorage for record keeping 
* sessionStorgae for session information
