A wordle

My attempt at replicating wordle to implement the lessons learnt over the last 4 weeks.
Focus on maximising use of DOM manipulation through JavaScript, and applying styling techniques in CSS to improve page aesthetics.

Future improvements:
* Adding functionality to onscreen keyboard.
* Improving responsiveness across webpage sizes and device types.
* Addition of local storage
* Addition of score board or scoring method
* General simplification of code
